Importing missing tiles from VeloViewer into EveryTile
------------------------------------------------------

You will need: sed and octave/matlab, both available for every linux distro

1) Get the KML file with yur missing tiles from your summary page on veloviewer.com, 

2) run mktiles.sh <kml_file> > tiles.txt

   this collects the relevant data from the kml file in a simple ascii file tiles.txt

3) Start octave (or matlab) and run 
   > tiles

   use resulting bmapstr in settings
