Importing missing tiles from VeloViewer into EveryTile
------------------------------------------------------

You will need: shell (with awk) and python, both available for every linux distro

1) Get the KML file with yur missing tiles from your summary page on veloviewer.com, 

2) run mktiles.sh <kml_file> > tiles.txt

   this collects the relevant coordinates data from the kml file in a simple ascii file tiles.txt

3) run tiles.py script with tiles.txt as an input along with longitude ant latitude (in that order!) of the home point
   > tiles.py tiles.txt 13.122137 52.428952

additionaly you can add zoom (default is 14) to genrate string for different zoom level (but then you have to provide proper tiles.txt file)
   > tiles.py tiles17.txt 13.122137 52.428952 17

  4) use resulting bmapstr in settings
