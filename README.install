This is a fork of EveryTile, a fantastic tool for tile hunting, modified to support hunting for squadratinhos (https://squadrats.com/), i.e., zoom level 17 tiles.
It does not work with http://www.shmo.de/EveryTile/ generator; to genrate a bmapstr you have to use scripts provided in the 'tools' folder.
